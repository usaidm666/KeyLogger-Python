# Keystroke Logger Script

This is a simple Python-based keystroke logger that records every key press on the keyboard and saves it to a text file named `keystrokes.txt`. 

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need to install the `keyboard` module, which can be done using `pip`.

### Installation

1. **Install Python:** If you don't already have Python installed, download and install it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install the `keyboard` Module:** Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install keyboard
   ```

## How It Works

- **Logging Keystrokes:** The script listens for key presses and writes each one to a file named `keystrokes.txt` in the same directory where the script is executed.

## Usage

1. Save the script to a file, for example, `keystroke_logger.py`.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python keystroke_logger.py
   ```

4. The script will start logging keystrokes and save them to `keystrokes.txt`.

5. **Stopping the Script:** To stop the script, you can manually interrupt it in the terminal by pressing `Ctrl + C`.
